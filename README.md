# JavaScript was a counter website. When you press the "+" button the count increaments by 1, when you press the "-" button the count decreases by 1 and when the "reset" button is pressed it puts the counter back to 0.

# I found -- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-simple-counter-using-html-css-and-javascript/ -- very useful. It was more useful than other tutorial becuase it talks you through the code.

# JQuery is a todo list program. It has the functionality to add a new item and to then delete.
